[MiniMyth](http://www.minimyth.org/index.html) is a small [GNU/Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) distribution that turns a diskless computer into a [MythTV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythTV) frontend and slave backend. It is built from source using a [GAR](http://lnx-bbc.com/garchitecture.html) based build system. It supports both network and local boot, with network boot being the primary boot method. It supports a range of hardware that is particularly well suited for use as a MythTV frontend, with a particular focus on [NVIDIA ION](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_Ion) and [VIA EPIA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPIA) hardware.
