MiniMyth Changelog 2005

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.18.1.9:

Updated init
    Fixed bug that caused minimyth.script to be required.
    Fixed bug that caused tarfile (*.tar.bz2) conf and tftp URLs to fail to be
        downloaded and mounted by mm_url_mount.

Updated packages
    Updated db/mysql.
    Updated kernel/linux.
    Updated system/zoneinfo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.18.1.8:

Added awk
    Updated package utils/busybox to include awk.

Added lsdvd
    Added package utils/lsdvd.

Updated init
    Changed graphical boot from bootsplash to gensplash. Gensplash runs in
        userspace, eliminating the need for a kernel patch. In support of this
        the package system/bootsplash was removed and the package
        system/splashutils was added.
    Enabled graphical boot provided that the kernel only logs errors to the
        console, and the frame buffer resolution is 800x600 with a color depth
        of 16-bits or more.
    Patched the kernel that so by default the kernel only logs errors to the
        console, and the frame buffer resolution is 800x600 with a color depth
        of 32-bits.
    Changed to the init from sysvinit rather than the init from busybox, because
        the init from busybox leaves zombie processes. In support of this the
        package system/sysvinit was added.
    Changed init scripts, including
        moving rc from /etc to /etc/rc.d,
        moving init scripts from /etc/minimyth.d to /etc/rc.d/init.d, and
        moving configuration files to /etc/conf and /etc/conf.d.
    Added support for mounting a binary codecs directory for MPlayer and Xine
        using the variable MM_CODECS_URL.
    Added support for downloading and mounting cramfs images to *_URL
        variables by adding the support to the mm_url_mount function.
    Changed the default values for MM_EXTRAS_URL and MM_THEMECACHE_URL from
        tarfiles (*.tar.bz2) to a cramfs images (*.cmg).

Updated LIRC support
    Replaced driver specific lircd daemons with one unified daemon.
    Added reasonable defaults for MM_LIRC_DEVICE when MM_LIRC_DRIVER is set to
        imon or streamzap.

Updated mm_* commands
    Moved all mm_* commands into /etc/rc.d/functions and made them accessible
        at the command line using the single command mm_command.

Updated MPlayer and Xine
    Change MPlayer and Xine to look for binary codecs in the directory
        /usr/lib/codecs rather than /usr/lib/win32, since both MPlayer
        and Xine use /usr/lib/codecs as the default binary codecs directory.

Fixed Xine so that it obeys MM_AUDIO_TYPE
    Fixed bug in the xine configuration file.

Modified Myth frontend menus
    Removed Import menu items, because CD and DVD importing is not supported.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.18.1.7:

Updated init
    Changed init to start logging and telnet before fetching and running
        minimyth.conf and minimyth.script. This allows logs and remote access
        to the MiniMyth front end as early as possible.
    Changed syslog to get the remote log server address from DHCP rather than
        minimyth.conf.
    Added a check to make sure that MiniMyth can connect to the Myth database.
    Changed init to not start a console or tty1 shell because they interfere
        with the bootsplash screen. However, there are now shells on tty2, tty3,
        tty4 and tty5 (and X is now on tty6).
    Stopped disabling X when debugging is enabled. If you want to disable X,
        then use MM_X_ENABLED=no.

Updated minimyth.conf
    Replaced MM_SOUND with MM_AUDIO_TYPE.
    Obsoleted MM_SOUND.
    Obsoleted MM_SYSLOG_SERVER.
    Added MM_VIDEO_ASPECT_RATIO to set the video aspect ratio. Right now, this
        is only used to control the aspect ratio for MPlayer. However, in the
        future, it may be use to clean up some of the MM_X controls.
    Added MM_VIDEO_DEINTERLACE_ENABLED to enable bob deinterlacing. This
        controls bob deinterlacing in MythTV, Xine and MPlayer.

Updated MPlayer
    Added Chris Audley's XvMC fallback patch (version 2). This enables MPlayer
        to fall back to a different video output and codec when the file
        cannot be played using XvMC with MPEG2 acceleration.
    Updated the MPlayer configuration file (/root/.mplayer/config) to enable
        MPlayer to take advantage of the XvMC fallback patch.

Added MythNews support
    Enabled the MythNews plugin.
    Added MM_MYTHNEWS_ENABLED to minimyth.conf.

Added Theora support
    Added Theora for philosophical reasons. There is no Theora content (yet).
        However, like Vorbis, Theora is a completely open codec, which is
        something that should be supported.
    Added package lib/libtheora.
    Enabled Theora support packages myth/mplayer and myth/xine-lib.

Updated packages
    Updated db/mysql.
    Updated devel/bison.
    Updated devel/libtool.
    Updated kernel/drm.
    Updated kernel/linux.
    Updated kernel/unionfs.
    Updated kernel/vt1121.
    Updated lib/libdrm.
    Updated lib/libtiff.
    Updated myth/mplayer.
    Updated qt/qt.
    Updated system/udev.
    Updated utils/lm_sensors.
    Updated utils/util-linux.
    Updated X11/SDL.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.18.1.6:

Updated X support
    Added minimyth.conf variables MM_X_DISPLAYSIZE_X and MM_X_DISPLAYSIZE_Y to
        control the horizontal display size and the vertical display size
        respectively.

Made root file system read/write
    Used pivot_root to make root file system read/write.

Changed X window manager
    Changed X window manager from ratpoison to aewm, because ratpoison was
        causing crashes with new Unichrome driver and with upcoming X11R6.9.
    Disabled X window manager by default, because MythTV "GUI X offset" and
        "GUI Y offset" settings do not work when the X window manager running.
    Added packages X11/aewm and X11/lesstif.

Updated Mesa support
    Changed X11/X11 so that it no longer builds libOSMesa.
    Added packages X11/Mesa and lib/libdrm.
    Removed package X11/unichrome_dri because it is replaced by package X11/Mesa.

Updated packages
    Updated db/mysql.
    Updated kernel/drm.
    Updated kernel/linux.
    Updated lib/libcdaudio.
    Updated lirc/lirc.

        file system before starting the LIRC daemon.
    Updated the mceusbnew driver.

    Added minimyth.conf variables MM_X_RESOLUTION_X, MM_X_RESOLUTION_Y and
        MM_X_REFRESH to control the horizontal resolution, the vertical
        resolution and vertical refresh rate respectively. Using
        MM_X_RESOLUTION_X and MM_X_RESOLUTION_Y rather than MM_X_MODE
        generates a modeline rather than using a built in modeline.
    Deprecated MM_X_RESOLUTION.

    Updated mm_message_output so that it writes to syslog as well.

Removed package kernel/cifs

        2.6.12.2 kernel contains the same version.

Added package kernel/vt1211
